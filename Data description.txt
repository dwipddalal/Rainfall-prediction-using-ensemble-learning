- **Date** - The date of observation<br>
- **Location** - The common name of the location of the weather station<br>
- **MinTemp** - The minimum temperature in degrees celsius<br>
- **MaxTemp** - The maximum temperature in degrees celsius<br>
- **Rainfall** - The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm<br>
- **Evaporation** - The so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am<br>
- **Sunshine** - The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day.<br>
- **WindGustDir** - The direction of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight<br>
- **WindGustSpeed** - The speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight<br>
- **WindDir9am** - Direction of the wind at 9am<br>
- **WindDir3pm** - Direction of the wind at 3pm<br>
- **WindSpeed9am** - Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 9am<br>
